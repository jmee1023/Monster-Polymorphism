This project demonsrates the use of polymorphism extensively. There are three categories of monsters for this project: Water monsters, Darkness monsters, and skymonsters. All of the monsters within the categories have unique abilites that are demonstrated in the minigame(can be found in "main". The superclass for the water monsters, is the watermonster itself, and its subclasses are the lake monster and the Sea monster. The superclass for the darkness monsters, is darkness monster itself, and its subclasses are the closet monster and under the bed monster. The last superclass is the sky monster and its sublclasses are cloud monster and comet monster. All of these sublclasses inherit a majority of their abilities from their superclass but also have useful abilites of their own that can be demonstarted in the files that end in "main". Whether it's their "scare" tactic, or their base constructor call, the game becomes pleasantly unique.  

These minigames demonstrate the monsters special abilites in an interactive way, giving the user a number of "moves" to pick from. The programs are also very repsonsive to the change caused by user input, by constantly displaying the current state of the monster or even number of people eaten! 

I have also demonstrated a number of test cases within the files that end in "Testing". In order to make sure these functions were working properly, a number of test cases had to be put into place and run on.
